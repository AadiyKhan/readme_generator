# Readme Generator ✨ Automated README Creation

Readme Generator is a powerful Python-based tool designed to automatically create comprehensive and engaging `README.md` files for your software projects. Leveraging Google's Generative AI, it intelligently scans your project structure, detects technologies, identifies dependencies, and synthesizes a professional README tailored to your codebase.

## Features

- **Automated Project Analysis**: Scans your project directory to identify key files, programming languages, and frameworks.
- **Dependency Detection**: Automatically lists Python dependencies using `requirements.txt` or similar mechanisms.
- **AI-Powered README Generation**: Utilizes Google GenAI to craft a detailed and well-structured `README.md` based on the project's analysis.
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Generates sections like Features, Tech Stack, Installation, Usage, and Project Structure tailored to your specific project.
- **Markdown Cleanup**: Formats and cleans the AI-generated markdown for optimal readability and adherence to best practices.

## Technology Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Python**: The core programming language that drives the entire application, from scanning to AI interaction.
- **Google GenAI**: Integrated to provide the advanced artificial intelligence capabilities for generating high-quality markdown content.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Readme Generator locally:

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AadiyKhan/readme-generator.git
    cd readme-generator

    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv

    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment**:

    -   On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate

        ```

    -   On Windows:

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate

        ```

4.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```

## Configuration

This project requires an API key for Google's Generative AI to function.

1.  **Obtain a Google API Key**:
    Visit the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to generate your API key.

2.  **Set the API Key as an Environment Variable**:
    The application expects the API key to be available in an environment variable named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

    -   On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

        ```

    -   On Windows (Command Prompt):

        ```bash
        set GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

        ```

    -   On Windows (PowerShell):

        ```powershell
        $env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

        ```

    Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key. For persistent configuration, consider adding this line to your shell's profile file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `config.fish`, or system environment variables).

## Usage

To generate a `README.md` for a project, navigate to the project's root directory and run the `main.py` script. By default, it will scan the current directory.

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is active** (as per installation steps).

2.  **Run the generator**:

    ```bash
    python main.py

    ```

    The generated `README.md` file will be created in the directory where `main.py` is executed.

## Project Structure

```
├── README.md
├── generator.py
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── scanner.py

```

-   `main.py`: The primary entry point for the application. It orchestrates the scanning, AI interaction, and final README generation process.
-   `scanner.py`: Responsible for analyzing the target project's file system, detecting technologies, dependencies, and extracting relevant code snippets for the AI prompt.
-   `generator.py`: Contains the logic for constructing a comprehensive prompt for the AI model based on the data gathered by `scanner.py`.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python package dependencies required to run the Readme Generator.
-   `README.md`: This file, generated by the tool itself or a placeholder for the generated output.
